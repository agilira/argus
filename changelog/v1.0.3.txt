# Changelog - Version 1.0.3

## Release Date
2025-10-15

## Summary
Added BoreasLite ring buffer implementation, isolated benchmark suite, and enhanced security tooling.

## Performance Improvements
- BoreasLite ring buffer: 39.02 million ops/sec (25.63 ns/op)
- Zero allocations in hot path (0 B/op, 0 allocs/op)
- 34% performance improvement over Go channels
- MPSC lock-free architecture with atomic operations

## Benchmarks Added
- Isolated benchmark suite in `/benchmarks` directory
- Dedicated go.mod to prevent test interference
- 5 benchmark scenarios covering different workloads
- Performance comparison vs Go channels and callbacks

## Security
- Added `govulncheck` vulnerability scanning
- Integrated `go mod verify` for dependency integrity
- Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with security checks
- Updated both Makefile and Makefile.ps1

## Build Tools
- New Makefile targets: `vulncheck`, `mod-verify`, `status`
- PowerShell equivalents in Makefile.ps1
- Enhanced `check` command with security validation
- Automated tool installation verification

## Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions workflow updated with vulnerability scanning
- Benchmark isolation prevents performance measurement interference
- Cross-platform build script enhancements
- Development tool status checking

## Technical Details

- Optimization strategies: SingleEvent, SmallBatch, LargeBatch, Auto
- Memory layout: 110-byte path support, cache-line alignment
- Event system: atomic flags for Create/Delete/Modify operations
